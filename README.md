## Syntax

Everything in a static match-function is static. Why run it?\
The answer is simple: don't. We cheat from home, do stuff at compile-time.

### Function.

Normies call them functions. This is a match-pattern on "*BCAAs*".

```java
public static fib =
    | 0 =>
    | 1 =>
    | n => fib n
    
fib 100
```

### Goto

Ah, gotos. It's what the kids want.

```lua
@swag

print "This will allow for easy maintainance and scalability."

goto @swag
```

### Flow control

```moon
let foo = 10 unless asparagus_in_retrograde

if foo
    print "The foo."
elif 100 == number (input "enter your age")
    print "Never too old to rush the B."
```

### Free

```moon
let a =
    name: "bob"
    age: 8
    height: true

free a

# Sorry, not gonna happen.
let b = a.name
```

### Loops

There might be some innovation here.

#### Static repeat

If you are familiar with Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V, this will be easy.

```fs
let i = 0
static repeat 6
    i += 1
    print "hehe: " i
```

#### The loop

```py
loop
    print "Chicks are temporary. Loop is forever."
    break
```

#### While and for

```py
for i in 0 .. 10
    print i

while false
    pass
```

## Q and the A

### Is this functional?

> Maybe. What is a monad?

### Why?

> This is the best language.

### Is it fast?

> We'll see.

### What?

> Pattern matching and pain.
